# Data 407 - Assignment 1:
### 1. (2 marks) Regarding measurement error, which of the following types are true?

**Answers: a, b, c, & d**

- **a. Respondent error** - is when respondent gives incorrect or inaccurate answers
- **b. Interviewer error** - is when the interviewer influences or records responses incorrectly
- **c. Instrument error** - is when faulty or poorly calibrated measurement tools are used
- **d. Operator error** - is when human error in using the instrument or recording data happens
- **e. Sampling error** - is **NOT** a measurement error; it arises from random sampling variability.

Thus: the answers are all except E

**Answers: a, b, c, & d**

### 2. (2 marks) Regarding selection bias, which of the following types are true?

**Answers: a, b, c, & d**

- **a. Sampling bias** - is when the sample is not representative of the population  
- **b. Selective survival** - is when only certain units remain observable (survivorship bias).
- **c. Volunteer bias** - is when participants differ systematically from non-participants
- **d. Non-response bias** - is when respondents differ from non-respondents
- **e. Sampling error** - is **NOT** random variation, not bias

Thus: the answers are all except E

**Answers: a, b, c, & d**

### 3. (2 marks) Regarding simple random sampling without replacement (SRS) from a population of \(N\) units, what is the probability that the first unit will appear in the sample of size \(n\)?

**Answer: a. \( \frac{n}{N} \)**

**Explanation:**  
In simple random sampling without replacement, each unit has the same inclusion probability:
\[
P(\text{unit included}) = \frac{n}{N}
\]
The phrase “first unit” does not change this probability

And the replacement component is irrelevant here since we are only considering the 1 case
