### 1. (2 marks) Which are true about the reasons for stratified sampling?

**Answers: a, b, c, & d**



- **a. Enhance representation** - ensures key subgroups are properly represented.
- **b. Reduce sampling bias** - especially when strata differ systematically.
- **c. Improve precision** - variance is reduced when strata are internally homogeneous.
- **d. Identify patterns and trends** - allows separate analysis within strata.
- **e. Make research easier and cheaper** - stratification **adds** cost and complexity.

Thus: the answers are all except E

**Answers: a, b, c, & d**

### 2. (2 marks) Which of the following is correct regarding the sampling of an SRS from each stratum?

**Answer: a. We independently take an SRS from each stratum.**

In stratified sampling - each stratum is sampled **independently** using SRS. Dependence would violate the design pre assumptions

### 3. (2 marks) Why would anyone ever take an SRS that is not stratified?

**Answers: a, b, c, & d**

- **a.** Stratification adds complexity and may not justify the gain in precision - **correct**
- **b.** We need auxiliary information to form strata - **correct**
- **c.** We must know which population members belong to each stratum - **correct**
- **d.** We must know both the size and membership of each stratum - **correct**
- **e.** SRS would produce better estimates - **IN-correct** stratification never worsens precision if done right

Thus: the answers are all except E

**Answers: a, b, c, & d**
