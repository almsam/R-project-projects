# *R Project* projects

Just a few projects I made using R for various credits during undergrad - made public for reference & education :3

Enjoy Y'ALL!

## Course details

### Data 310
This was a course on classical machine learning - Applied Regression Analysis - where we learnt how to derive the linear regression algorithm from scratch & how to use it in the world

### Data 311
This course covered the entire tip of the machine learning iceberg - we covered decision trees, neural networks, regression, component analysis, & clustering

### Data 315
An extension for 310 - this course showed my cohort & I how to analyze a time series of data. From white noise to Moving Average & Auto Regression, & even ARMA, ARiMA, & sARiMA - we learnt how to model seasonal data of many kinds
